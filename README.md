Metall (Meta Allocator)
====================
* Provides rich memory allocation interfaces for C++ applications that use persistent memory devices to persistently store heap data on such devices.
* Creates files in persistent memory and maps them into virtual memory space so that users can access the mapped region just as normal memory regions allocated in DRAM.
* To provide persistent memory allocation, Metall employs concepts and APIs developed by [Boost.Interprocess](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/interprocess.html).
* Supports multi-threa
* Also provides a space-efficient snapshot/versioning leveraging reflink copy mechanism in filesystem. In case reflink is not supported, Metall automatically falls back to regular copy.
* Example programs that use Metall are listed [here](#example).



# Getting Started



## Use Metall in Your Project

Metall consists of only header files and requires some header files in Boost C++ Libraries.
All core files exist under [metall/include/metall/](./include/metall).
All you have to do is just setting include paths such as '-I' or CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH.

For example,
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -lstdc++fs your_program.cpp -I/path/to/metall/include -I/path/to/boost/include
```
Note GCC requires linking stdc++fs to use the Filesystem library in C++17.


### Required

 - GCC 8.0 or more.
 - Boost C++ Libraries 1.64 or more (build is not required; needs only their header files).



## Limitations To Store Objects Persistently

To store objects persistently, there are some limitations as listed below.

* Raw pointers
    * When store pointers persistently, raw pointers have to be replaced with offset pointers because there is no guarantee that backing-files are mapped to the same virtual memory address every time.
    * An offset pointer holds an offset between the address pointing at and itself.
* References
    * References have to be removed due to the same reason as raw pointers.
* Virtual Function and Virtual Base Class
    * As the virtual table also uses raw pointers, virtual functions and virtual base classes are not allowed.
* STL Containers
    * Some of STL containers' implementations do not work with Metall ([see detail](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/interprocess/allocators_containers.html#interprocess.allocators_containers.containers_explained.stl_container_requirements)).
    * We recommend using [containers implemented in Boost.Interprocess](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/interprocess/allocators_containers.html#interprocess.allocators_containers.containers_explained.containers)
     as they fully support persistent allocations.

Some example programs that use Metall are listed [here](#example).



## Build Example, Test, and Benchmark Programs
Metall's repository contains some example, test, and benchmark programs.

```bash
git clone [this repository]
cd metall
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost/root/
make
make test    # option; BUILD_TEST must be ON
```

### Required

 - cmake 3.8 or more.
 - GCC 8.0 or more.
 - Boost C++ Libraries 1.64 or more (build is not required; needs only their header files).


### Additional Cmake Options

In addition to the standard cmake options, we have two additional options:
* BUILD_BENCH
    * Builds subdirectory bench/
    * ON or OFF (default is ON).
* BUILD_TEST
    * Builds subdirectory test/
    * ON or OFF (default is OFF).
    * Google Test is automatically downloaded and built if BUILD_TEST is ON and SKIP_GTEST_DOWNLOAD is OFF.
* RUN_LARGE_SCALE_TEST
    * Runs large scale tests which could use ~ 100GB of storage space in /dev/shm or /tmp..
    * ON or OFF (default is OFF).
    * If BUILD_TEST is OFF, this option is ignored.
* SKIP_GTEST_DOWNLOAD
    * Experimental option
    * Skips downloading Google Test (see more details below).
    * ON or OFF (default is OFF).
    * If BUILD_TEST is OFF, this option does not do anything.


### Build 'test' Directory without Internet Access (experimental mode)

    Step 1) Run cmake with BUILD_TEST=ON on a machine that has an internet access.
    Step 2) Run cmake with BUILD_TEST=ON and SKIP_GTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON on a machine that does not have an internet access

For example,
```bash
# On a machine with the internet
cmake ../ -DBUILD_TEST=on # Use cmake to just download Google Test. You might also need specify BOOST_ROOT option
# On a machine without the internet
cmake ../ -DBUILD_TEST=on -DSKIP_GTEST_DOWNLOAD=on # also other options you want to use
```
Google Test is downloaded in the first step and built in the second step.


## Example

Example programs are located in [example/](example/)
* [simple.cpp](./example/simple.cpp)
    * A simple example of allocating a vector container.

* [vector_of_vectors.cpp](./example/vector_of_vectors.cpp)
    * An example of nested (multi-level) containers.

* [offset_pointer.cpp](./example/offset_pointer.cpp)
    * An example code using the offset pointer to store pointer persistently.

* [snapshot.cpp](./example/snapshot.cpp)
    * An example code that snapshots and copies the snapshot files to a new place.
